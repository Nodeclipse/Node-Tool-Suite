by Paul Verest at Funshion.com for Nodeclipse

# Instructions

0. If you don't have, get latest Node.js http://www.nodejs.org/download/

1. If you don't have, download & install latest JDK

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

For example "Java Platform (JDK) 7u21"

2. Download Node Tool Suite (NTS) for your operating system (currently only Windows x64 & MacOS x64)

3. Extract NTS.zip into folder where you keep our tools, e.g. D:\Progs\

4. Open eclipse.exe from Eclipse folder, e.g. D:\Progs\Node-Tool-Suite-03-win64\eclipse\eclipse.exe

5. If you have error messages like

	....\jre\....
	
	That means you don't have JDK installed (JRE is not enough).
	
	Reinstall JDK (see 1.) or use [hint how to configure Eclipse](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/eclipse-node-ide/blob/master/Hints.md#select-jvm-for-eclipse-instance)
	
6. You default Workspace (folder where you keep you projects) is ..\workspace, 
 e.g. D:\Progs\Node-Tool-Suite-03-win64\workspace
 
 Change it to more suitable place, e.g. D:\Workspaces\NodeDev
